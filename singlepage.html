				   <p class="sub">In a normal Internet advertising environment, the relationship between websites, advertisers, users and advertising center is a bidirectional relationship. They cooperate with each other, but also intensely compete with each other. Websites attract users and provide advertising spaces. Advertisers provide advertisement and pay for it. Advertising center allocate advertising space to advertisement according to certain rules, and collect fees, and share with websites. Users browse and click the ad. This 4 in 1 system is the reason why most of websites and servers are free, and how tech companies (like Google, Facebook) earn money. <br><br>
It is obviously, in this system, that advertisers play the important role. Therefore, how to make advertising more effective and greater propaganda became a hot topic now. It also spawned a new sub-discipline, computational advertising. We can say computational advertising is a very narrow area under machine learning. However, as it generates huge profits every year, this discipline has become very popular. Now computational advertising already has become frequent visitor to many academic conferences in computer science field as well as economic field. 
We can simply separate computational advertising as display ads and search ads. <br><br>
A display ad is an internet advertisement that appears as a picture or video, when a user browses a website. Its main purpose is brand promotion rather than directly facilitating transactions. This is because when users are browsing websites, usually they do not have a clear and specific purchase intention. It is not easy to stimulate their purchase desire. Hence, usually, display advertising comes with bright colors, lively pictures. It will attract the attention of the users and give them a certain impression. According to the current industry standards, as long as the advertising platform has performed an advertisement for a certain number of times, the advertiser will pay for a corresponding fee. This model is commonly referred as a CPM model. <br><br>
A search ad is when users use search engines searching certain things, what advertisements they saw on the results pages. Search ads usually displayed in a similar format as search results, including headers, descriptions and hyperlinks. With the development of technology, search results have become more pluralistic. The form of search advertising is usually enriched with pictures, videos. Unlike the display ads, users usually have a clearer intention to purchase something when search on searching engine. And these intentions are usually veiled through query keywords. In order to precisely match the users’ search intention, advertisers have to submit keywords that they want to bid in advanced and the highest fees they are willing to pay. According to industry standard practice, the ad platform charges the advertiser only when the user clicked on an ad. This is CPC model. <br><br>
In this proposal, we are going to mainly discuss search ads. The most popular charging model in search advertising is the click charging model, so accurately click forecasting plays a crucial role in advertising platform. This model often be called CTR. <br><br>
Machine learning is the core of CTR, because the purpose of machine learning is prediction. However, as we all know, algorithms can only process abstract and elegant objects/data. In real life, our tasks are concrete, so our data are full of defects and noises. How to use abstract algorithms to solve concrete problems is the main question among all. Usually, we have two ways to predict in Machine Learning, regression and classification. Regression often is used to handle classifying objects, like human faces, tables, bicycles. Classification is more likely to deal with numbers. <br><br>
CTR is typically modeled as a classification problem. Given a user’s query terms, advertisements, user information and other contextual information. It predicts whether a click will occur. <br><br>
This problem seems simple, but it is actually very complicated. The data of which ad user clicked are rare. Even high-quality advertisements only have few percent click rate. For such data, if the training set sample is unreasonable, or not so good, we lost many important information, which will lead to model invalidation. Currently, the only effective feature of click prediction is its historical click behavior. However, although this is a valid feature, is has brought many challenges to CTR prediction. If you rely too heavily on historical click behavior, it will bring a lot trouble. For those ads that have not been shown to users in history, even if they are high-quality ads themselves, or maybe they are too new, or not displayed due to mistakes in the previously used click model, these new ads will not have opportunities to show to users in the future. Thus, this will form a vicious circle and the CTR prediction model will not be improved by training. And CTR prediction model will gradually consolidate the prediction results into a small number of appeared data. <br><br>
In order to solve this problem, we need to use online learning to achieve the balance of exploration and utilization. There has been a lot of useful work in this area, but there is still much room for development. For example, when doing online learning, user behavior is often regarded as a “random environment” and the characteristics of the user’s click are understood through exploration. However, this method ignores the change of the CTR prediction model, which will also lead to change in the ordering of advertisements. Thus, this will affect the advertisers' profits, prompt advertisers to change keywords and their bids, and even change the way advertisements are written. These changes in turn will affect the click prediction model itself, which affects the revenue of the advertising platform. Therefore, an ideal online learning method should detect user click behavior and advertiser behavior at the same time.<br><br>
